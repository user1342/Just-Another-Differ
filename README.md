Just Another Differ (JAD) is a command-line tool for comparing two binary files. It uses fuzzy string matching and Ghidra's decompilation to analyze function similarities between binaries. A great example of using JAD is when reviewing a newer version of a binary that has stripped or obfuscated function names compared to an older version which does not - JAD will produce a map of the functions in the new binary that are the closest in similarity to the old binary.

* **üî¨ Function Finding:** JAD will produce an output map of function similarities between two binaries.
* **üåê Outputs:** JAD can produce a text, HTML, or stdout output for the mapping it produces.
* **üõ†Ô∏è Ghidra Enabled:** JAD uses Ghidra headless to enable decompilation of functions!

JAD was inspired by anouther tool I created with the same purpose for Android APKs, see [Obfu-DE-Scate](https://github.com/user1342/Obfu-DE-Scate)!

# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

## Dependancies

JAD requires [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) to be installed, and for ```analyzeHeadless``` to be on your path. If
it is not on your path JAD will request on run where the binary is located. To install all other dependencies use
the ```requirements.txt``` file, with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running
JAD must be provided with both a base binary (```--binary-one/-b1```) and a comparison binary (```--binary-two/-b2```). In addition to this if an output option can be chosen between ```--text-output``` for a text file map or ```--html-output``` for a HTML file. If no output is chosen JAD will display the map to the terminal.

JAD usage can be seen below:

```bash
usage: JAD.py [-h] --binary-one BINARY_ONE --binary-two BINARY_TWO
              [--text-output TEXT_OUTPUT | --html-output HTML_OUTPUT]
```
